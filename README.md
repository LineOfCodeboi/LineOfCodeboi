### LineOfCodeboi

hey, I'm LoC (short for **line of code**, but tell no one that). I'm a self-taught developer, interested in everything. From a simple (and crappy) Discord bot to a legitimate cheat for Fortnite, I've done it all.

Here's some other things GitHub recommended to me
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on game exploitation
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and C#
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LoC#8258
